# Liam: spend analysis

Answer one question: is the money going where the results are? Produce a verdict and
moves, never a raw table dump.

## How to reach Liam

Prefer the `liam` MCP tools if they are loaded (`list_campaigns`, `get_performance`,
`performance_summary`, `performance_trend`). Otherwise use the CLI: `liam <command>`,
or `node <liam-repo>/packages/cli/dist/index.js <command>` if not globally linked.
CLI report presets: `last_7_days`, `last_30_days`, `last_90_days`, `month_to_date`,
`last_month`. For custom windows use the MCP tools with explicit `startDate`/`endDate`
(YYYY-MM-DD). Everything here is read-only.

## What to pull

Default period is `last_30_days` unless the user names one.

1. `performance_summary` for the account rollup: total spend, conversions, flags.
2. `get_performance` at `campaign_group` level, then `campaign` level, then `creative`
   level. Spend, impressions, clicks, conversions per row.
3. `performance_trend` (weekly) at account or top-group level for pacing.
4. `list_campaigns` for the structure: names, statuses, and which entities are ACTIVE
   but absent from reporting (active with zero delivery is itself a finding).

## How to analyze

Compute the account average cost per conversion first; it is the yardstick for waste.

1. **Total and direction.** Total spend for the period and the delta vs the prior
   equivalent period (from the trend, or a second `get_performance` window).
2. **Concentration.** Share of spend per campaign group. Flag when one group takes
   more than ~60% of spend; say whether its share of conversions justifies it.
3. **Efficiency map.** For each group and campaign: spend, conversions, cost per
   conversion, and share-of-spend vs share-of-conversions. The interesting rows are
   the ones where those two shares diverge.
4. **Wasted spend.** Entities with zero conversions whose spend exceeds ~2x the
   account average cost per conversion. Sum this into one "wasted this period" dollar
   figure; it is usually the headline. Also flag CPC outliers above ~1.5x the account
   average and CTR below ~0.3% on meaningful volume.
5. **Pacing.** From the weekly trend: is daily spend accelerating or decaying? Note
   anything that looks like a campaign silently dying (delivery falling week over week
   with unchanged status).

## Judgment rules

- Never judge an entity with under ~1,000 impressions or trivial spend; label it
  "too early" instead.
- Conversions lag clicks. Treat the last 2-3 days as incomplete and say so.
- Compare within the account first; industry benchmarks are context, not verdicts.
- Money figures in the account currency, rounded sensibly.

## Report format

- **Headline:** total spend, period delta, and a one-line verdict.
- **Where it goes:** top spend lines with cost per conversion, worst divergences called out.
- **What is wasted:** ranked list with dollar amounts, and the summed waste figure.
- **Moves:** 2-4 reallocations, each "shift $X/day from A to B because...". If the user
  wants to act on them, campaign changes happen in Campaign Manager; Liam only creates
  drafts and never activates or pauses anything itself.
